This is particularly interesting for JavaScript, which is a flexible and forgiving language that allows for a wide variety of stylistic choices.\nGoogle and Airbnb have two of the most popular style guides out there. I’d definitely recommend you check out both of them if you spend much time writing JS.\nThe following are thirteen of what I think are the most interesting and relevant rules from Google’s JS Style Guide.\nThey deal with everything from hotly contested issues (tabs versus spaces, and the controversial issue of how semicolons should be used), to a few more obscure specifications which surprised me. They will definitely change the way I write my JS going forward.\nFor each rule, I’ll give a summary of the specification, followed by a supporting quote from the style guide that describes the rule in detail. Where applicable, I’ll also provide an example of the style in practice, and contrast it with code that does not follow the rule.\nUse spaces, not tabs\nAside from the line terminator sequence, the ASCII horizontal space character (0x20) is the only whitespace"
